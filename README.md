üé¨ Movie Recommender System: Neural Networks vs Collaborative Filtering
A comprehensive comparison of Deep Neural Networks and Traditional Collaborative Filtering for movie recommendations using the MovieLens 100K dataset.
üìä Project Overview
This project implements and compares three recommendation approaches:

Collaborative Filtering (User-Based with Cosine Similarity)
Neural Collaborative Filtering (Deep Learning with Embeddings)
Hybrid Model (Weighted Ensemble)

üöÄ Quick Start
Run in Google Colab (Recommended)
python# Copy the complete code from movie_recommender.py
# Upload to Google Colab and run all cells
Run Locally
bash# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Siphephelo-dev/DataScienceProject.git


# Install dependencies
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow

# Run the script
python movie_recommender.py
üìÅ Dataset
MovieLens 100K - Automatically downloaded by the script

100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 movies
Rating scale: 1-5 stars
Sparsity: 93.7%
Source: GroupLens Research

üî¨ Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing

Load ratings and movie data
Create user/movie index mappings
Split into train (80%) and test (20%) sets

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
Generates 6 visualizations analyzing:

Rating distribution
User activity patterns
Movie popularity
Average ratings
Correlation heatmaps

3. Model Training
Collaborative Filtering:
pythoncf_model = CollaborativeFiltering(n_neighbors=50)
cf_model.fit(train_data, n_users=943, n_movies=1682)
Neural Collaborative Filtering:
Architecture:
- User Embedding (943 √ó 50)
- Movie Embedding (1,682 √ó 50)
- Dense(128) + BatchNorm + Dropout(0.3)
- Dense(64) + BatchNorm + Dropout(0.3)
- Dense(32) + ReLU
- Output(1)

Total Parameters: 155,315
Hybrid Model:
pythonhybrid_model = HybridRecommender(cf_model, nn_model, alpha=0.4)
# Prediction = 0.4 √ó CF + 0.6 √ó NN
üìà Results
